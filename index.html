         <h2>Parasite and Keeper Information</h2>
         <p>The true origin of these anomalies isn't yet known. Parasite pods are formed underground, and upon reaching fresh air, hatch into what we see today. Using spores, parasites will then lure a person closer, forcing them to be its caretaker. A parasite cannot survive without the keeper, so <abbr title="The Branch of Parasitic Research">BPR</abbr> strives to contain the keepers in a safe, guarded habitat in one of our facilities.</p>
         <p>Both of these species are very dangerous, and come in many forms. Most keepers are mutated upon being exposed to spores. (See <u>Public Keeper Case Logs</u> to find out more about the mutations.) Some keepers do not have any outward mutations, and a few have been known to freely walk amongst the public, which we at the Branch of Parasitic Research perceive as threats to public safety.</p>
         <p>Parasites are highly intelligent, using floral mimicry and spores to deceive people and animals into a false sense of safety. Most parasites drastically change the environment that they infect, though some need a specialized eye to detect and locate. Parasites are omnivores, though their diet mainly consist of living prey. If you notice strange thoughts that are out of place, or an urge to start walking to any remote location, cover your mouth and nose. Do not engage with parasite or keeper activity. If you think that you are being exposed to spores, promptly call your local BPR-PD and explain the situation. Remain focused and vigilant until help arrives. If there are others in your immediate area, warn them immediately.</p>

         <p>Please leave clear and concise information regarding your concerns, the location, missing person reports, unusual landscape or flora, and any suspected keeper sightings. If you think someone you know is harboring a keeper, or hiding a parasite's location, please contact your local BPR-PD.
